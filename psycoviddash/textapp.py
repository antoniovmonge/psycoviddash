    Individuals’ general **stress levels** were measured using an established ten-item 
    scale developed by psychologists Cohen, Karmak, and Mermelstrein (1983). 
    [PSS-10](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0875-9)
      
    This scale measures participants’ stress during the last week by using indicators
    of stress responses, for instance, perceived lack of control over events, 
    pressure from mounting difficulties and feeling upset about unexpected changes.
      
    Scores (from 1 to 5) are considered moderate above 2.4, and high above 3.7.

    Short self-report scale of loneliness (SLON-3) based on the [UCLA loneliness
    scale.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b855bd5cef372d1e9a8ef0e/t/5ccc5008b208fcd615da0870/1556893704715/Measuring+Loneliness+Scale+SEOAT.pdf)
      
    This scale comprises 3 questions that measure three dimensions of loneliness: relational connectedness,
    social connectedness and self-perceived isolation.
      
    Outlined below is the UCLA 3 Item Loneliness Scale. This version created in 2004, is considerably shorter
    and easier to administer than the original 20 question instrument. The survey can be administered in
    various ways – either through asking the questions during an interview or assessment or provided to an
    older adult to read and respond to the questions independently.
